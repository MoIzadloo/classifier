# Classifier
This repository explores various classification algorithms commonly used in machine learning. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific task and the characteristics of the data.

## Perceptron
A perceptron is a fundamental building block of artificial neural networks. It is a simple, single-layer artificial neuron that takes one or more inputs, applies a weighted sum of the inputs, and then applies a threshold to the result. This threshold determines whether the perceptron fires an output of 1 or 0.

## Install
